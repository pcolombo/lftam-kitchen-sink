OG Kitchen Sink build for TAM training

:x: This is an outdated version of Kitchen Sink used only for internal TAM training. If you are not a TAM please use: https://github.com/Livefyre/kitchen-sink 

## Requirements
This version of Kitchen Sink is built with [CodeIgnighter](http://ellislab.com/codeigniter), and requires PHP & Apache. If you're not familiar with local web development I reccomend using [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info).

Kitchen Sink uses the client-solutions LFEP network for login. Make sure you are an owner on this network.

## Setup

### 1. Get Livefyre Credentials

1. Clone this project into your server root. Contact Paul / DE if you need help setting up a local web server using MAMP.

2. Log into powertools and get the Network Key for client-solutions.

3. Make yourself a site in the client-solutions network:
  1. Use your Livefyre username as the name for your site: e.g. http://pcolombo.livefyre.com.
  2. Make note of your Site ID and Site Key.
  3. Make yourself a new Curate collection with some Twitter/Instagram content to populate the Media Wall and Gallery views. (Iâ€™m a fan of [@staypuft](http://twitter.com/staypuft) on Twitter myself. He posts often enough with a mix of text and images.) Make note of the ArticleID created by Livefyre.

4. In `/application/config/constants.php`, set the following variables (starting on line 48):
  * `LIVEFYRE_NETWORK_SECRET` - the network key for client-solutions.fyre.co
  * `LIVEFYRE_SITE_ID` - the site id for the site you created in step 2.2
  * `LIVEFYRE_SITE_KEY` - the site key for the site you created in step 2.2
  * `LIVEFYRE_SITE_URL` - the url for the site you created in step 2.2
  * `DEMO_ARTICLE_ID_PREFIX` - replace YOURUSERNAME with, e.g.: 'pcolombo_local_'

5. In `/application/models/data_cache.php`, set the following:
  * For the `mediawall` and `gallery` items, set `ARTICLE_ID`, add the article id generated by Livefyre in step 2.3. E.G if the article id is `custom-12345`:

  ```
	"mediawall" => array(
		ARTICLE_ID      => "custom-12345",
		ARTICLE_TITLE   => "Media Wall",
		ARTICLE_URL     => "mediawall"
	),
	"gallery" => array(
		ARTICLE_ID      => "custom-12345",
		ARTICLE_TITLE   => "Streamhub Gallery",
		ARTICLE_URL     => "gallery"
	)
  ```

6. [Edit your hosts file](http://decoding.wordpress.com/2009/04/06/how-to-edit-the-hosts-file-in-mac-os-x-leopard/) to point `local.livefyre.com` to `127.0.0.1`. (Livefyre will not create collections for the default localhost domain.)

7. Go to http://local.livefyre.com in your browser.
